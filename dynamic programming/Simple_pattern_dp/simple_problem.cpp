/*Given an integer “N” ; find the minimum cost to reduce it to 1
The operations you can do are as follows.->

i) Reduce the number by 1 in “y” dollars; 

ii) Reduce the number by /7 in “x” dollars.(if number is divisible by 7)

iii) Reduce the number by /3 in “z” dollars;(if number is divisible by 3)

iv) Reduce the number by /5 in “b” dollars;(if number is divisible by 5) 

(1<=n<=100000)


Understanding :->

N = 15 

Y = 100 
X = 1 
Z = 500 
B = 10000000
